Mechanizing Your Proofs
=======================

This will be a short introduction to proof assistants via [Lean][] for an audience who is already familiar with both functional programming and formal pen-and-paper proofs about programming languages.
The plan is to use it in Cornell's [CS 6110][], our grad programming languages class, as a bonus topic.

I'm just getting started, but you can see the in-progress document [online][live].
